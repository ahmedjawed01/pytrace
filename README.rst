PyTrace
========
PyTrace is written on the top of `Bdb <https://docs.python.org/2/library/bdb.html>`_ that will execute small python programs within a sandbox environment and collects heap & stack information on each setup.
Collected information can be later used to demonstrate program execution on GUI. Thanks for checking it out.
